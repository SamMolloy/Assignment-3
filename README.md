Third OOP Assignment of a game

Instructions:

The instructions are quite simple as all you need are the movement keys which are the arrow keys on the keyboard.
This is told to the user right on the home screen along with how to start the game(by pressing enter). Also once the
player dies they are shown a game over screen and told how to return to the menu to try again(pressing shift).

Game Mechanics:

The objective in this particular game is to collect the green square moving around your screen. This may sound easy but
there are plenty of enemies in your way. To begin there will only be 3 enemies but as you collect more of the green squares
you will spawn more and more enemies. There are 2 types of enemies in the game, one is small and fast and the other is larger
but slower. There is a limit to 15 enemies at once so as to prevent the screen from being too cluttered. There is also a timer
 that will increase the enemies speed making the game harder. There is no limit to how fast they can become so that is where 
 the games real difficulty lies.

Key Features:

The key features that I was pleased with in this game were my use of Polymorphism whereby I stored both types of enemy object
in the same arraylist. This was a little tricky to implement but was worthwile once completed. I also used inheritance between
multiple classes such as the enemies and also the life and score counters.
